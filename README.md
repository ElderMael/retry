Ceylon Utilities

Inspired by Erik Meijer talk in React 2014: [Erik Meijer - What does it mean to be Reactive?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSQlYX5DU0) 
I decided to create a series of utilities in my favorite programming language to use the emulate the type
`Future<Try<Optional<T>>>` using a somewhat ceylonic approach that will be `Future<Try<Type?>>>` but also 
create the monads with the powerful type system to create an idiomatic API.
